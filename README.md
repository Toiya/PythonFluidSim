# PythonFluidSim

This graphics project implements a simple fluid simulation in Python using NumPy and Pygame, and is based on the Navier-Stokes equations using a grid.

It was made mainly with the help of The Coding Train's video [Coding Challenge #132: Fluid Simulation](https://thecodingtrain.com/challenges/132-fluid-simulation), Mike Ash's article [Fluid Simulation for Dummies](https://mikeash.com/pyblog/fluid-simulation-for-dummies.html), and Jos Stam's paper [Real-Time Fluid Dynamics for Games](https://www.dgp.toronto.edu/public_user/stam/reality/Research/pdf/GDC03.pdf). The Ten Minute Physics video [17 - How to write an Eulerian fluid simulator with 200 lines of code](https://youtu.be/iKAVRgIrUOU) was also very helpful.
